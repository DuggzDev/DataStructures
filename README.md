# DataStructures
This is a repository containing data structures and algorithms.

Use a _**queue**_ when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in.

Use a **_stack_** when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in.

Use a **_list_** when you want to get anything out, regardless of when you put them in (and when you don't want them to automatically be removed).
