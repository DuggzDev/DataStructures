# Data Structures
This is a repository containing data structures and algorithms.

Use a _**queue**_ when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in.

Queue's useful where? **First in First out**

1. Keyboard buffers (letters should appear on the screen in the order they're pressed).

2. Printer queue's (print job should be completed in that order)
3. Used in Linked-Lists, PriorityQueues and Breadth-first search.

Use a **_stack_** when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in.

Stack useful where? **Last in First out**

1. Reversing a string

2. Browser use stack data structure to keep track of last visited sites.

3. Recursion

Use a **_list_** when you want to get anything out, regardless of when you put them in (and when you don't want them to automatically be removed).

List's useful where?

1. For recording a large amount of data
2. To store and collect a large amount of data
3. Multiple types of lists such as Arraylist, Linkedlist, etc.
